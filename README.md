## Description
This project was built using node.js and inquirer (as well as the fs npm package). The appication takes  user input on the command line and then uses that data to build an HTML document listing all team members on cards with their corresponding information. 

## Usage
This is a slick app for quickly entering your team of employee's information and displaying it all on one clean, usable interface. To test this application, clone this repository to your device, open in your text editor, run the command npm install in your terminal to ensure you have all the necessary packages installed. 

Then, in your terminal use the command 'node index.js' to launch the application. :)
